# stockpile
A components logging online app for making life easier for lenting components from IEEE library

## Problems to solve
1. A complete history of who took what components from the IEEE components available and store it an easy to access and manage way.
   Book and pen is old school and much too clumsy.
2. Have a record of available components that all the IEEE members can have a look at in case they need something.
